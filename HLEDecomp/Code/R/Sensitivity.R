# PLAN: when we 'finalize' transition probability specification, 
# change state space to 1) Never D vs Ever D and 2) Never D vs DFED vs D
# Q to check: when recovery improves, in homogenous model, years lost in Disability
# translate to 'more' years gained in DF. This is because they are assigned the same
# rates, etc. Just want to know how bad this Markov homogeneity assumption is.
# No sense doing this until transition probabilities are in order, however.
