This repository contains materials for two papers in progress.
1) Tim Riffe "A decomposition approach for discrete time multistate models"
2) Tim Riffe, Neil Mehta, Daniel Schneider, and Mikko Myrskyl√§ "Trends in United States life expectancy and disability above age 50: Delayed onset, improved recovery, mortality change, or compositional change?"

This will become a more structured README when we have something to report.
